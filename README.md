# OIBGRIP

Following tasks that i have done during this internship
1)Number Guessing Game:

In this game, the user must guess the randomly-generated number in 10 attempts. If the user is unsuccessful in finding the correct number, he will lose the game. However, if he manages to guess it correctly, he will be rewarded based on how many attempts it took him to do so. Working on this project gave me an excellent opportunity to hone my Java programming skills and apply them in a practical setting.

-You can fork the code and play the game there is no prerequisite

2)ATM Inteface:
The second project at Oasis Infobyte was to develop an ATM interface on which a user can register as a new client and perform transactions such as money transfers, deposits, withdrawals, checking their balance, and changing their PIN. Working on this project allowed me to hone my Java programming skills as well as explore solutions to logical problems. It was a fun and rewarding experience. As a part of my internship, As a result, it truly has been a great learning experience for me during my time here. I am very grateful for this amazing internship opportunity that Oasis Infobyte has provided me with!

#how to implement code into your PC
- To use this ATM Interface fully you must have a SQL Workbench to store and retrieve the data
- SQL can be downloaded on the web 
- after installing SQL you should establish a connection and keep the username and password
- and then create schema name as [atm_interface]
- create two table name as [account] and [transaction_table]
- In the [account] table create Field name as:
                           * Account_No: this field has to be primary key because you can't make it again and it can't be null
                           * User_Name
                           * Age
                           * Address
                           * Mobile_No
                           * PIN
                           * Balance
                           
- In the [transaction_table] table create Field name as:
                           * Account_No
                           * Credit
                           * Debit
                           * Transaction_Date
                           * Credited_To
                           * Debited_From
