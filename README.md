# OIBGRIP

Following tasks that i have done during this internship

1)Number Guessing Game:

In this game, the user must guess the randomly-generated number in 10 attempts. If the user is unsuccessful in finding the correct number, he will lose the game. However, if he manages to guess it correctly, he will be rewarded based on how many attempts it took him to do so. Working on this project gave me an excellent opportunity to hone my Java programming skills and apply them in a practical setting.

-You can fork the code and play the game there is no prerequisite

2)ATM Inteface:

The second project at Oasis Infobyte was to develop an ATM interface on which a user can register as a new client and perform transactions such as money transfers, deposits, withdrawals, checking their balance, and changing their PIN. Working on this project allowed me to hone my Java programming skills as well as explore solutions to logical problems. It was a fun and rewarding experience. As a part of my internship, As a result, it truly has been a great learning experience for me during my time here. I am very grateful for this amazing internship opportunity that Oasis Infobyte has provided me with!

#how to implement code into your PC

- To use this ATM Interface fully you must have a MySQL Workbench to store and retrieve the data
- 
- SQL can be downloaded on the web 

- after installing SQL you have to establish a connection and keep the username and password

- Download this dumps.zip file i have already saved both of table [account] or [transaction_table].

- Zip file of database: [dumps.zip](https://github.com/mirzaAfnanBaig/OIBGRIP/files/10324276/dumps.zip)

- Open MySQL go to server and import this file, yess! you will get the file
 
- This project is done in the code editer name as Intellij Idea IDE

- You can download code editor on the web {Download Community edition Intellij idea}

- To interact Java code with SQL there's a JAR file that you have to add into Intellij Idea. 
- Download Jar Zip file :[mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.zip](https://github.com/mirzaAfnanBaig/OIBGRIP/files/10324631/mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.zip)

#how to add JAR file

1. Open Intellij
2. Click on file 
3. Open Project Structure
4. Select Modules
5. Click on Dependencies
6. Click on (+) icon and then JAR option
7. Add the downloaded zip file into it

Ater doing this successfully fork the code.
